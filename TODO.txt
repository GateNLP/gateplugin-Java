make it possible to run code before cleanup: this can help when we process a corpus
  with gcp and we want to process corpus statistics or similar
  !!! deal with multithreading and custom diplication for this!!!


Extend editor:
  = allow search/replace etc: http://bobbylight.github.io/RSyntaxTextArea/
    to build everything that is needed, needs to have the various component dirs installed in parallel!
  = allow to start without a java file then pick one etc? 
  = better handling of line numebers for error messages. 
  = better handling if isInterrupted etc.
